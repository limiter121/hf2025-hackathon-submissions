AppwriteHub

## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

The project I created is a centralized community-driven platform for discovering, deploying, and managing powerful pre-built functionalities for your Appwrite projects.

- Zero Setup: Deploy features in minutes, not days or weeks
- Community Powered: Leverage the power of the vibrant, global network of Appwrite developers to solve common project needs
- Easy Maintenance: A centralized way to track and apply updates to your deployed functionalities

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The reason I chose this idea was because I love Appwrite and want to improve upon it - also, there was no simple solution to add common functionalities (ex. CMS) in my Appwrite projects.
I am really thrilled to get feedback from the Appwrite team and the community about this project - let's make Appwrite the best there is!

## Tech Stack    
_How have you built this project? Mention the technologies/methods/platforms you used to build your project_

The technologies I used are Next.js, Mantine, Node.js, Prettier and of course Appwrite.
Coding was done in VS Code by me with very little help from AI (mainly used Windsurf for autocomplete and Gemini for marketing texts).
